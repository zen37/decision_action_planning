# Decision {#decision}

## Overview {#overview}

Decision making is just what it sounds like: the action or process of making decisions.   
It is a cognitive process of choosing between different options or courses of action.  Decision making involves evaluating information, considering possible outcomes, and selecting a path that aligns with a person's goals, values, or preferences. Decision making can range from simple choices (e.g., what to eat) to complex decisions (e.g., strategic business planning). It often includes steps like identifying the problem, gathering information, weighing alternatives, and making the final choice. Good decision-making balances logic, emotion, intuition, and the available data.   
Making a decision involves thinking, even if in the end you might decide not to think too much about it, but even this ‘not to think about it’ involves thinking. 

Effective decision making requires a combination of skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and negotiation. It also requires the ability to manage uncertainty and make decisions under conditions of incomplete information. Ultimately, the goal of effective decision making is to make the best possible decision, given the available information and the individual's goals, values, and preferences.

There are several decision-making frameworks and models that help guide the process, but before listing them one should be aware of the psychological factors that influence decision making, as they are crucial for understanding human behavior when deciding on the course of action.

## 

## Psychological and Emotional Factors in Decision Making {#psychological-and-emotional-factors-in-decision-making}

### Prospect Theory {#prospect-theory}

Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, ‘Prospect Theory’ explains how people make decisions under risk. It shows that individuals value potential gains and losses differently—people are generally more sensitive to losses than to equivalent gains. The theory also highlights that people tend to overestimate unlikely outcomes while underestimating more probable ones.

Research has shown that if someone gives you $100 you will experience a boost in satisfaction, but if you lose $100 you will experience a dramatically higher loss in satisfaction.  
This explains why many investors hold on to their losing investments for longer than they should. A loss making investment on paper becomes more painful when that loss becomes real by selling the respective investment so many people prefer not to do it.

### Cognitive Dissonance Theory {#cognitive-dissonance-theory}

Proposed by Leon Festinger, ‘Cognitive Dissonance Theory’ suggests that individuals experience psychological discomfort when holding conflicting beliefs or making decisions contrary to their values. To reduce this discomfort, they may change their beliefs or justify their actions.

People have a tendency to search for and favor information that confirms our beliefs while simultaneously ignoring or devaluing information that contradicts their beliefs.

Suppose a person believes that eating fast food is unhealthy and that they should eat a balanced diet. However, they often find themselves eating fast food when they are busy or on the go. When they eat fast food, they feel guilty and experience cognitive dissonance because their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs.

To reduce this dissonance, the person may seek out information that confirms their belief that fast food is unhealthy. They may read articles about the health risks associated with fast food, watch documentaries about the food industry, or discuss the topic with friends who share their values.

At the same time, the person may also engage in justification strategies to minimize their guilt and maintain their fast food habit. For example, they may convince themselves that eating fast food once in a while is not a big deal, or they may try to rationalize their actions by focusing on the convenience and taste of fast food.

Over time, the person's exposure to information about the health risks of fast food and their justification strategies may lead to changes in their beliefs and behaviors. They may become more aware of the health risks associated with fast food and may make a conscious decision to eat healthier options more often. Alternatively, they may continue to eat fast food but may feel less guilty about it and may make an effort to balance their diet with other healthy foods.

Benjamin Franklin stuck with his resolution of not eating animal food for a long time, however during a sea trip he decided to strata eating eat fish rationalizing it by: “*when the fish was opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs: then thought I, "if you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.”*

He aptly put it: *So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.*

Both theories illustrate the psychological factors that influence decision-making, going beyond purely rational models.

## 

## Decision Making Frameworks {#decision-making-frameworks}

### Rational Decision-Making Model {#rational-decision-making-model}

The Rational Decision-Making model is a structured, step-by-step approach that aims to make logical and objective decisions. Its key steps are:

1\. Define the Problem: clearly identify the issue to be resolved.  
2\. Gather Information: collect relevant data and information to understand the problem fully.  
3\. Generate Alternatives: brainstorm potential solutions or courses of action.  
4\. Evaluate Alternatives: assess the pros and cons of each option, weighing factors like risks, benefits, and costs.  
5\. Choose the Optimal Solution: select the best alternative based on a logical analysis of the information.  
6\. Implement the Decision: put the chosen solution into action.  
7\. Evaluate the Outcome: review the results to ensure the decision solved the problem and adjust if necessary.

This model is typically used in situations that allow for thorough analysis and data gathering, promoting well-reasoned decisions based on objective criteria. However, it can be time-consuming and may not be ideal in fast-paced or uncertain environments where decisions must be made quickly.  
 

### Pros and Cons Analysis {#pros-and-cons-analysis}

Pros and Cons Analysis is a straightforward tool that involves listing the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of each option and weighing them to make a balanced decision. This approach is based on the assumption that the best decision is the one that has the most advantages and the fewest disadvantages.

Here are the steps involved in Pros and Cons Analysis:

1\. Identify the options: identify the different options that are being considered.  
2\. List the pros and cons: for each option, list the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) that are relevant to the decision-making situation.  
3\. Weigh the pros and cons: assign a weight or value to each pro and con, based on its importance or significance to the decision-making situation.  
4\. Compare the optionsL compare the weighted pros and cons of each option to determine which one has the most advantages and the fewest disadvantages.  
5\. Make a decision: based on the comparison of the options, make a decision that is consistent with the individual's goals, values, and preferences.

Pros and Cons Analysis is a simple and easy to use tool, helps visualize and organize thoughts, and is useful for small or personal decisions. However, subjective judgment may affect the weighting of pros and cons and doesn’t work well with complex decisions that require deep analysis or have multiple stakeholders involved.

### SWOT Analysis {#swot-analysis}

SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool that helps decision-makers identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with each option. It is based on the assumption that the best decision is the one that maximizes the strengths and opportunities while minimizing the weaknesses and threats.

Here are the steps involved in SWOT Analysis:

1\. Identify the options: identify the different options that are being considered.  
2\. Identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats: for each option, identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that are relevant to the decision-making situation. Strengths are the positive attributes or advantages of the option, weaknesses are the negative attributes or disadvantages of the option, opportunities are the external factors that favor the option, and threats are the external factors that pose a risk to the option.  
3\. Analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats: analyze each strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat to determine its importance or significance to the decision-making situation.  
4\. Compare the options: compare the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of each option to determine which one has the most advantages and the fewest disadvantages.  
5\. Make a decision: based on the comparison of the options, make a decision that is consistent with the individual's goals, values, and preferences.

SWOT Analysis provides a comprehensive view of both internal and external factors and it helps in identifying areas for improvement and potential risks. However, it has limitations as subjectivity in identifying factors can bias results and it may not provide clear solutions but highlights areas to explore further.

### Decision Matrix {#decision-matrix}

Decision Matrix is a structured tool used to evaluate and prioritize different options based on multiple criteria. Here’s how it works:

1\. Define Options: list the alternatives or choices you are considering.  
2\. Identify Criteria: determine the factors that are important for making the decision; these could include cost, feasibility, time, and impact.  
3\. Weight Criteria: assign weights to each criterion based on their importance relative to the decision.  
4\. Score Options: evaluate each option against the criteria, giving scores (typically on a scale, such as 1-5 or 1-10).  
5\. Calculate Weighted Scores: multiply the scores by the weights for each criterion and sum them up for each option.  
6\. Compare Total Scores: the option with the highest total score is generally considered the best choice.

The decision matrix model provides a clear visual representation of the evaluation process, helps eliminate bias by quantifying subjective judgments, and facilitates group decision-making by standardizing evaluations.  
However, it may become overly complex with too many criteria or options and the quality of the matrix is dependent on the accuracy of the weights and scores assigned.

### OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) {#ooda-loop-(observe-orient-decide-act)}

The OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) is a decision-making model developed by military strategist John Boyd, designed for high-stakes situations. It emphasizes a continuous cycle of observation, orientation, decision-making, and action. 

1\. Observe: gather data from the environment to understand the current situation.  
2\. Orient: analyze the information, considering various factors like past experiences and context to form a clear picture.  
3\. Decide: choose the best course of action based on the analysis.  
4\. Act: implement the decision, leading to new observations, and restart the cycle.  
However, the OODA Loop may not be as effective or appropriate in more routine or predictable decision-making situations, where a more deliberative and systematic approach may be more appropriate. In these situations, other decision-making frameworks and models, such as the Rational Decision-Making Model, may be more appropriate.

### Six Thinking Hats {#six-thinking-hats}

Six Thinking Hats is a creative decision-making framework that involves viewing the problem from six different perspectives. The Six Thinking Hats approach was developed by Edward de Bono, a British psychologist and author, and it is based on the assumption that the best decision is the one that is made by considering a wide range of perspectives and viewpoints.

The Six Thinking Hats framework involves viewing the problem from six different perspectives, each represented by a different color of hat. The six hats are:

1\. White Hat: focuses on the facts and data, and involves gathering information and analyzing data to understand the problem.  
2\. Red Hat: focuses on emotions and feelings, and involves identifying and addressing the emotional aspects of the problem.  
3\. Black Hat: focuses on the negative aspects of the problem, and involves identifying and addressing the potential risks and downsides of the problem.  
4\. Yellow Hat: focuses on optimism and possibilities, and involves identifying and addressing the potential opportunities and benefits of the problem.  
5\. Green Hat: focuses on creativity and innovation, and involves generating new ideas and solutions to the problem.  
6\. Blue Hat: focuses on the overall process of decision making, and involves managing the decision-making process and ensuring that it is fair, inclusive, and effective.

Here are the steps involved in using the Six Thinking Hats framework:

1\. Identify the problem: clearly define the problem or opportunity that needs to be addressed.  
2\. Put on the hats: take turns putting on each of the six hats and focusing on the perspective that the hat represents.  
3\. Discuss the problem: discuss the problem from the perspective of each hat, and gather information, identify risks and opportunities, and generate ideas and solutions.  
4\. Make a decision: based on the discussion and the information gathered, make a decision that is consistent with the individual's goals, values, and preferences.

The Six Thinking Hats framework offers several benefits, including comprehensive decision-making, creativity, inclusivity, and balanced thinking. It encourages participation, fosters communication, and considers multiple perspectives. However, it can be time-consuming, may struggle with complex decisions, and introduce bias through emotional and optimistic perspectives.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis {#cost-benefit-analysis}

Cost-Benefit Analysis is a decision-making framework that involves evaluating the costs versus the benefits of different decisions quantitatively. It is based on the assumption that the best decision is the one that has the highest net benefit, or the difference between the benefits and the costs of the decision. kHere are the steps involved in Cost-Benefit Analysis:

1\. Identify the alternatives: identify the different alternatives that are being considered.  
2\. Identify the costs and benefits: for each alternative, identify the costs and benefits that are relevant to the decision-making situation. Costs may include direct costs, such as the cost of materials or labor, as well as indirect costs, such as the opportunity cost of not pursuing other opportunities. Benefits may include financial benefits, such as revenue or savings, as well as non-financial benefits, such as improved efficiency or customer satisfaction.  
3\. Quantify the costs and benefits: quantify the costs and benefits of each alternative, using a consistent unit of measurement. This may involve using financial data, such as revenue or expenses, or non-financial data, such as customer satisfaction scores or efficiency metrics.  
4\. Calculate the net benefit: calculate the net benefit of each alternative by subtracting the costs from the benefits.  
5\. Compare the alternatives: compare the net benefits of each alternative to determine which one has the highest net benefit.  
6\. Make a decision: based on the comparison of the alternatives, make a decision that is consistent with the individual's goals, values, and preferences.

The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) framework provides a systematic evaluation of costs and benefits, enabling decision-makers to make objective choices, untainted by emotional bias. By quantifying results, CBA facilitates comparison of options and helps prioritize projects or investments. This approach also fosters thorough consideration of costs and benefits, promoting informed decision-making. Additionally, CBA aids communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and transparent evaluation process.  
However, CBA also has its limitations. One major drawback is the difficulty in quantifying intangible costs and benefits, such as environmental impact or social welfare. Furthermore, predicting future costs and benefits inherently involves uncertainty, which can undermine the accuracy of CBA. The framework's emphasis on monetary values may also overlook important non-monetary factors. Moreover, CBA neglects distributional effects, ignoring who bears the costs and receives the benefits. The approach assumes rational decision-making, disregarding behavioral factors that can influence choices. Finally, conducting a comprehensive CBA requires significant data and resources, which can be a barrier to its implementation.

### Simple Rules {#simple-rules}

Professors Kathleen Eisenhardt and Donal Sull offer a better way to make decisions in their book ‘Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World’

The authors identify two types of simple rules: Those that can help you make decisions and those that can help you do things. Decision rules set boundaries, prioritize alternatives, and establish stopping points.   
For example Cardinal football players follow three simple rules when deciding what to eat: eat breakfast and eat as much as you want of anything that can be picked, plucked, or killed.

In a world where algorithms and large datasets are often cited as essential for decision-making, it may seem counterintuitive to suggest that simple rules can be more effective in managing complexity. However, the authors argue that simple rules are actually better suited to taming complexity than complex solutions. This is particularly true in situations where quick decision-making and action are necessary, such as in a military field hospital or a new company's leadership team.

To be effective, simple rules must meet certain conditions. First, they should be limited in number, as this makes them easier to remember and apply. Second, they should be tailored to the individual or organization using them, as different people and organizations may have different needs and constraints. Third, they should be applied to well-defined activities, as this ensures that they are relevant and applicable. Finally, they should allow for discretion, as this enables people to adapt the rules to their specific circumstances and make decisions that are appropriate and effective.

Overall, the authors argue that simple rules are a practical and effective approach to decision-making in complex and uncertain environments, and that they can be more effective than complex solutions in situations where quick decision-making and action are necessary. By meeting certain conditions, simple rules can be tailored to the individual or organization using them, and can enable people to make better decisions and take effective action.

### 

### Intuition {#intuition}

This model relies on unconscious processes, experience, and gut feelings to guide decisions rather than systematic, analytical methods. It’s particularly useful in situations where time is limited or where there’s a lack of complete information. Intuitive decision-making is common in areas like emergency responses or complex environments where quick judgments are needed based on prior knowledge or instinct. It complements more structured models by offering a faster, more experience-based approach.
